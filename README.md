# Kudzai---Azure---Resume---Project
My Personal Azure Resume Project - Creating an Azure hosted website as part of showcasing my current skillset and the skills that I am learning and working towards for a career in cloud engineering. I am utilizing Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Azure Blob storage, creating a CNAME record for the website and implementing https. I am undertaking this also to get a start with web developing using html, css, and javascript. 

# Notes 
-Frontend contains the website code in the index.html file
-main.js contains visitor counter code using java script
-created azure function using azure tools in visual studio code
-Pointed the index.html file to main.js to get the counter attached to the website
-Currently trying to get website working with Azure Function. The function works but the site is not taking the counts
